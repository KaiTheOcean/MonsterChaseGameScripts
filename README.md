# Overview

The purpose of this program is to help me learn how Unity works by making a simple game application.

I found a very useful tutorial on YouTube, and I followed along with him while doing this project. By pressing left and right arrow key to control the player's movement, and by pressing the space bar will allow the player to jump. The goal of this game is to avoid those up coming monsters from left and right sides.

Below is the quick demo of how I wrote this software.
